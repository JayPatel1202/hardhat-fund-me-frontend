# Hardhat Fund Me Front-End

# Getting Started

## Requirements

You need absolutely nothing then the ABI(Application Binary Interface) (which is going to be the same by far as the contract is same) and the address of the deployed comtract and do the required edit in the ```constant.js```.
You also need to have a metamask account and also import the testnet you are working with and the account for signing the transaction

# Thank you!
